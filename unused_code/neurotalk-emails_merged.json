Recent advances have begun to unravel the\n   mysteries of how mindfulness practice can affect learning\n   processes leading to positive habit change. Using evidence\n   from clinical trials of smoking cessation, this presentation\n   will first map out how mindfulness targets key components of\n   operant conditioning pathways. It will then detail\n   neuroscientific findings from novice and expert meditators\n   using traditional and real-time fMRI to link the subjective\n   experience of effortless awareness that may be a key aspect\n   of mindfulness, to regional brain activity in the default\n   mode network. It will conclude with a discussion of how\n   targeted neurofeedback may provide a \u201cmental mirror\u201d for\n   augmenting mindfulness training. \n    \n    Bio \n\n\n\n   Judson Brewer MD PhD is the Director of Research at the\n   Center for Mindfulness and associate professor in medicine\n   and psychiatry at UMass Medical School. He also is adjunct\n   faculty at Yale University, and a research affiliate at MIT.\n   A psychiatrist and internationally known expert in\n   mindfulness training for addictions, Brewer has developed\n   and tested novel mindfulness programs for addictions,\n   including both in-person and app-based treatments. He has\n   also studied the underlying neural mechanisms of mindfulness\n   using standard and real-time fMRI, and is currently\n   translating these findings into clinical use. He has\n   published numerous peer-reviewed articles and book chapters,\n   spoken at international conferences, presented to the US\n   President\u2019s Office of National Drug Control Policy, been\n   featured at TEDx, Time magazine (top 100 new health\n   discoveries of 2013), Forbes, Businessweek, NPR and the BBC\n   among others.

We are developing a framework that\n unifies parametric and nonparametric models, frequentist and\n Bayesian inference, small data and big data, beginning courses that\n differ from traditional courses by teaching methods for simple data\n in ways that extend to complex high dimensional data (similar to the\n goal of teaching finite dimensional math in the notation that extend\n to Hilbert space). To accomplish the above, a theory, called LP\n STATISTICAL SCIENCE, is being developed by myself and Subhadeep\n (Deep) Mukhopadhyay (Temple University Fox School of Business). The\n theory is unifying because it applies to mixed data (variables which\n are discrete or continuous) and to population and sample\n distributions. It practices &quot;plug-in estimation&quot; computed for sample\n distributions by the same definitions used for population\n distributions. \n  \n  Short Bio :\u00a0 Emanuel Parzen is a Distinguished Professor\n Emeritus, Dept. of Statistics, Texas A&amp;M University. He has\n served as an Assistant Professor of Mathematical Statistics at\n Columbia, Professor of Statistics at Stanford, a Leading\n Professor-Chairman of the Dept. of Statistics and a Director of\n Statistical Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo,\n and a Distinguished Professor at Texas A&amp;M University. He has\n been a Fellow at Imperial College London, IBM Systems Research\n Institute, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences\n at Stanford, and a Visiting Professor at the Sloan School of MIT,\n the Dept. of Statistics at Harvard and the Dept. of Biostatistics at\n Harvard. Professor Parzen has authored or coauthored over 120 papers\n and 6 books, on signal detection theory, time series analysis and\n non-parametric statistics. He pioneered the use of kernel density\n estimation (also known as the Parzen window in his honor) and\n Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) in statistics and\n engineering. He has served on innumerable editorial boards and\n national committees, and has organized several influential\n conferences and workshops. He has been elected Fellow of the\n American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical\n Statistics and the American Association for the Advancement of\n Science. In 1994, he was awarded the prestigious Samuel S.

At certain frequencies, LFP oscillations appear to modulate single-neuron excitability, suggesting that they provide a means of organizing perception through time. In this talk I will\n suggest that oscillations provide an interface between the oculomotor and visual systems. Recordings from multi-electrode arrays in V4 of macaque monkeys show that saccades shape the pattern of oscillatory activity across retinotopic space in such a way as\n to prioritize the processing of behaviorally relevant information. \n \n  \u00a0 \n Friday, May 2, 2014 at 2:00pm \n  \u00a0 \n  \u00a0 \n Boston University \n 677 Beacon Street \n Auditorium, Room B02 \n Boston, MA 02215 \n Refreshments to follow. \n  \u00a0 \n For more information on upcoming events, visit\n  http://compnet.bu.edu   \n \u00a0 \n ****************************** ****************************** ****************************** ************************ \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Sarah Swenson\n \n Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology\n \n Senior Program Coordinator\n \n 677 Beacon Street \n Boston, MA 02215 \n  swensons@bu.edu", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Swenson, Sarah Mae\" <swensons@bu.edu>", "subject": "TOMORROW! 2PM: Christopher Pack, CompNet Seminar"}, {"date": "2014-04-30T23:05:13.000Z", "bodyText": "Please save the date for this seminar\n       \n      \n     \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        View this email in your browser \n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        \n\n\n           \n\n\n        \n       \n      \n     \n    \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        We are pleased to announce the following event at Boston University: \n \n The 20th Annual Henry I.

Towards that end, he has developed innovative approaches to monitor and manipulate motor-related neural circuits underlying complex\n behavioral sequences.\u00a0 His work extends to a variety of model systems, including humans, songbirds, and a wild-caught Costa Rican rodent species.\u00a0\n  \n \nIn his young career, Michael has received a number of awards and fellowships including the Esther A. &amp; Joseph Klingenstein Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences, the Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Award, and the Robertson Investigator Award from the New York\n Stem Cell Foundation.

Despite the known importance of this brain region, deeper investigation of the normal bioelectrical activity patterns of the EC in awake, behaving primates is necessary. I recorded the activity of individual neurons and populations of neurons in the EC of rhesus macaque monkeys during free-viewing of photographs. The results of these experiments help to explain how primates form memories of, and navigate through, the visual world. Neurons were discovered in the EC that represent visual space with triangular grid receptive fields. This property is similar to grid cells previously described in the rodent EC, but here the neuronal responses relate to viewing of remote space as opposed to representing the physical location of the animal. Intermixed with spatial neurons were neurons that encoded aspects of recognition memory. Interesting activity patterns related to recognition memory were further present at the population level. Synchronization within the gamma-band (30-140 Hz) in superficial layers of the EC was modulated by stimulus novelty, while the strength of memory formation modulated gamma-band synchronization in the deep layers and in layer III. Furthermore, the strength of connectivity in the gamma-band between different layers was correlated with the strength of memory formation: deep to superficial power transfer was correlated with stronger memory formation and superficial to deep transfer was correlated with weaker memory formation. These findings support previous investigations of hippocampal-entorhinal connectivity in the rodent and advance our understanding of the functional circuitry of the medial temporal lobe memory system. \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups &quot;NaK short list&quot; group. \nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to nak-short-list+unsubscribe@ googlegroups.com . \nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/ optout .", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Jonathan Cannon <The.Ocean.Is.Tea@gmail.com>", "subject": "Data Analysis Group talk: Grid cells in primates"}, {"date": "2014-04-03T14:28:40.000Z", "bodyText": "Dear all, \n \n  Here is a reminder for our tomorrow JC, third floor, at 1 pm. \n \n  Hope to see you all, \n  Arash \n \n \nOn Mar 31, 2014, at 4:42 PM, &quot;Yazdanbakhsh, Arash&quot; &lt;yazdan@bu.edu&gt; wrote: \n \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;  Dear all, \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;  This Friday, Sam Ling, from the Department of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences at Boston University will present in our Friday journal club. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;  Given the classical thought that LGN does not process orientation information, it should be a very stimulating talk.

I will provide a survey of the empirical literature examining this possibility, with the hope that this will spur discussion as to whether this has any ramifications for current models of visual processing. \n \n \n  Hope to see you all. \n\n  Arash", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Yazdanbakhsh, Arash\" <yazdan@bu.edu>", "subject": "Friday JC (week 130). *1pm*, 3rd floor-- Does the LGN process orientation information?"}, {"date": "2014-03-31T12:53:49.000Z", "bodyText": "Wednesday, 4/2, 4pm, MCS241 Talker: Michelle M. McCarthy  Talk:\u00a0 Multiple time scale dynamics of excitation-induced pauses in globus pallidus neurons \n Abstract: \nThe basal ganglia consist of a set of subcortical nuclei that function in coordination of movement, habit formation, and reward-based learning. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated with a host of neurologic and psychiatric diseases including Parkinson&#39;s disease, Huntington&#39;s disease, addiction and depression. The central nucleus of the BG is the globus pallidus externus (GPe). Approximately half of GPe neurons regularly display pauses in their spiking activity. Both the function and the mechanism of these pauses are currently undetermined. Computational modeling has identified a possible mechanism for these pauses. The mechanism is excitation-induced and depends on two slow membrane currents with widely different time scales. The proposed mechanism has readily apparent functional implications for the larger basal ganglia network. We discuss approaches to characterizing the key dynamical interactions that promote pauses in order to identify specific physiological conditions mediating both function and dysfunction in these networks.\u00a0 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups &quot;NaK short list&quot; group. \nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to nak-short-list+unsubscribe@ googlegroups.com . \nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/d/ optout .", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Jonathan Cannon <The.Ocean.Is.Tea@gmail.com>", "subject": "NaK: WED, 4/2, 4pm"}, {"date": "2014-03-26T14:13:54.000Z", "bodyText": "The Graduate Program for Neuroscience is pleased to welcome Kwanghun Chung, Ph.D. From the Picower Institute for Leaning and Memory.

This amounts to a form of structured &quot;edge&quot; in which &quot;ownership&quot; of a nearby &quot;shape&quot; \nis explicitly encoded in the neuronal response. In this meeting, this finding will be discussed in the larger context of \nthe problem of \u201cNeuronal Representation&quot;. The various theories of representation that have been considered range over \nthe single cell feature extraction (grandmother cell), Gestalt ideas of &quot;one-to-one&quot; representation, Gibsonian ideas \nof &quot;perception-action&quot;, topographic representation (via maps/columns), and von der Heydt&#39;s &quot;boundary ownership&quot;. \nThe discussion will focus on these various conceptual frameworks, and, in particular, von der Heydt&#39;s apparent rejection of \nthe notion of a surface based representation (neo-Gestalt?) in favor of a pure, but structured, &quot;edge&quot; representation. \n \nAn example of a recent &quot;retinex&quot; solution will be shown, in order to illustrate the difficulty with this idea, and to make explicit what an \n&quot;edge&quot; versus &quot;surface&quot; representation actually &quot;looks&quot; like, and the problematic, though intriguing nature of some of von der Heydt&#39;s \nthinking in this area. \n \n  Hope to see you all, \n  Arash \np.s. check out a few attached PDFs \n \n============================ \nArash Yazdanbakhsh, MD, PhD, \nResearch Assistant Professor, \nComputational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet) \nProgram in Cognitive and Neural Systems, Boston University \nCenter of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science and Technology \nhttp://cns.bu.edu/~yazdan/ \n============================", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Yazdanbakhsh, Arash\" <yazdan@bu.edu>", "subject": "Friday JC (week 129). *1pm*, 3rd floor--  Neuronal Representation by Eric Schwartz"}, {"date": "2014-02-26T15:43:08.000Z", "bodyText": "3:30pm (30 min early!), Wednesday (today), 2/26, MCS241 \n (Head to the CRC dinner afterwards!)

Early studies in this emerging field of brain\n connectomics have focused on mapping brain network topology and identifying some of its characteristic features, including small world attributes, modularity and hubs. More recently, the emphasis has shifted towards linking brain network topology to brain\n dynamics, the patterns of functional interactions that emerge from spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity.\u00a0 I will give an overview of recent work characterizing the structure of complex brain networks, with particular emphasis on studies demonstrating how\n the network topology of the connectome constrains and shapes its capacity to process and integrate information.  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n CELEST Science of Learning Seminar Series  \n \u00a0 \n Friday, February 21, 2014 at 2:00pm  \n \u00a0 \n Boston University  \n 677 Beacon Street  \n Auditorium, Room B02  \n Refreshments will be served after the talk in Room B03\n  \n \u00a0 \n For more information on upcoming events, visit\n http://celest.bu.edu  \n ****************************** ****************************** ****************************** *****************************  \n \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \n Sarah Swenson \n \n Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology\n  \n Senior Program Coordinator\n  \n 677 Beacon Street  \n Boston, MA 02215  \n swensons@bu.edu", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Swenson, Sarah Mae\" <swensons@bu.edu>", "subject": "Friday, February 21st: Olaf Sporns, Science of Learning Seminar"}, {"date": "2014-02-13T19:22:04.000Z", "bodyText": "Reminder for our tomorrow JC. \n  Kyle Lepage will present his contribution in DPSS and introduce us with the idea and basic/practical examples in Vision and Auditory System (please see below). \n  Hope to see you all, \n  Arash \n \n \n \n \nOn Feb 10, 2014, at 11:11 PM, &quot;Yazdanbakhsh, Arash&quot; &lt;yazdan@bu.edu&gt; wrote: \n \n&gt;  Dear all, \n&gt; \n&gt;  This week, our Friday JC, hosts Kyle, who will present his research on discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSSs). \n&gt; \n&gt;  Below please find Kyle\u2019s abstract for his talk: \n&gt; \n&gt; The discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSSs) are a set of pair-wise orthogonal sequences, each of which is optimally signal-energy-concentrated within a specified frequency interval.

Through experience, the brain learns to use this noisy and incomplete data to infer and predict the current and future states of its surroundings and to generate appropriate behaviors. Despite the fundamental importance of this ability as it relates to executive behavior and cognition, little is known about its neural basis. This talk will present evidence that visual experience can encode specific predictive spatiotemporal sequence representations in primary visual cortex (V1). These findings support the hypothesis that temporal sequence coding is a fundamental ability of neocortical circuits, not a specialization of higher cortical association areas, and suggest that V1 can be used to mechanistically study how the brain uses past experience to make &quot;intelligent guesses&quot; based on limited information.\n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n\n\n       \n\n\n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n        Seminar Details \n \n 4:00 PM  \n Thursday, February 6, 2014  \n\n Room 103 \n\n \n 24 Cummington Mall, LSEB \n \nWine and Cheese Reception following seminar in LSEB Lobby \n\u00a0 \n \n\n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n   \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        Copyright \u00a9 2014 Boston University, All rights reserved. \n \n You are receiving this email because you are affiliated with the Boston University Graduate Program for Neuroscience\n  \n  \n  Our mailing address is: \n  \n  Boston University 72 East Concord Street, Boston, MA Boston , MA 02118 Add us to your address book \n  \n  \n  unsubscribe from this list \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  update subscription preferences", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "NeuroDome <neurodome@bu.edu>", "subject": "Neurobiology Search Seminar: Jeffrey Gavornik, Thursday Feb 6"}, {"date": "2014-01-31T21:49:48.000Z", "bodyText": "Please save the date for this seminar\n       \n      \n     \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        View this email in your browser \n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        \n\n\n           \n\n\n        \n       \n      \n     \n    \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        We are pleased to announce the following seminar at Boston University: \n \n From Circuits to Behavior: New Concepts in Olfactory Processing  \n Department of Biology \nNeurobiology Search Seminar \n Dr. David Gire \nHarvard Univeristy \n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        Abstract: The complex patterns of neural activity in our brains do not recreate every detail of the external world, but rather efficiently and adaptively represent behaviorally relevant information derived from a constant stream of sensory input. This is particularly noticeable in the case of olfaction, since a smell is seldom experienced without a rich collection of learned associations. In this talk, I will present studies in the olfactory system that demonstrate both the neural codes used to efficiently represent behaviorally important information as well as the neural circuit mechanisms that support these codes. These studies provide new insights into the neural mechanisms through which sensory stimuli are combined with behavioral associations to generate efficient sensory codes in behaving animals.\n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n\n\n       \n\n\n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n        Seminar Details \n \n 4:00 PM  \n\n  Monday, February 3, 2014  \n\n Room 103 \n\n \n 24 Cummington Mall, LSEB \n \nWine and Cheese Reception following seminar in LSEB Lobby \n\u00a0 \n \n\n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n   \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        Copyright \u00a9 2014 Boston University, All rights reserved. \n \n You are receiving this email because you are affiliated with the Boston University Graduate Program for Neuroscience\n  \n  \n  Our mailing address is: \n  \n  Boston University 72 East Concord Street, Boston, MA Boston , MA 02118 Add us to your address book \n  \n  \n  unsubscribe from this list \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  update subscription preferences", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "NeuroDome <neurodome@bu.edu>", "subject": "Neurobiology Search Candidate: Dr. David Gire, Monday Feb 3"}, {"date": "2014-01-30T15:17:25.000Z", "bodyText": "We will have a special Chalk Talk Speaker-Adam Johnson on \nTuesday , February 11, at 9:30 am, 5 Cummington-113.

Declarative memory critically depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) -- the hippocampal formation and surrounding parahippocampal gyrus -- as well as on interactions between the MTL and other cortical and subcortical structures. Recent progress in understanding human MTL function has come from the application of distributed pattern analyses of functional MRI data. In this talk, I will discuss how such analyses can be leveraged to delineate (a) the distinct computations subserved by MTL cortex and hippocampus in recognition memory, (b) the relationship between hippocampal and cortical processes at encoding and retrieval, and (c) the role of hippocampal-dependent pattern completion in across-event integration. \n       \n      \n     \n\n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n   \n    \n\n\n \n  \n   \n    \n     \n      \n\n\n       \n\n\n      \n     \n    \n    \n     \n      \n      Seminar Details: \n \n\t Friday, September 20, 2013 at 2:00pm \n\t677 Beacon Street \n\tAuditorium, Room B02 \n\tRefreshments will be served after the talk in Room B03 \n \n\t For more information on upcoming events, visit http://celest.bu.edu \n\n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n        \n\n\n           \n\n\n        \n       \n      \n     \n    \n  \n \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n            \n             \n              \n               \n              \n             \n            \n           \n          \n         \n         \n        \n        \n         \n         \n          \n           \n            \n  \n   \n    \n\n     \n      \n\n       \n\n        Copyright \u00a9 2013 Boston University, All rights reserved. \n \n You are receiving this email because you are affiliated with the Boston University Graduate Program for Neuroscience\n  \n  \n  Our mailing address is: \n  \n  Boston University 72 East Concord Street, Boston, MA Boston , MA 02118 Add us to your address book \n  \n  \n  unsubscribe from this list \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  update subscription preferences", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "NeuroDome <neurodome@bu.edu>", "subject": "Cognitive Neuroscience Seminar"}, {"date": "2013-09-16T14:17:41.000Z", "bodyText": "Sept.16-22 Participate in Car-Free Week This message is from:\u00a0 Maureen Lacey\u00a0 maurenl@bu.edu \u00a0638-7473 TranScomm encourages you to take part in Massachusetts Car-Free Week: Pick A Day, Commute Another Way!

How well do we and our patients understand who is responsible for maintaining continuity of follow-up to prevent lapses in care? This new program will bring together different disciplines to talk with each other about key communication issues that leave patients vulnerable to errors and adverse outcomes. We\u2019ll bring together primary care, oncology, radiation oncology, and other related specialty clinicians and team members to begin these important conversations.

Blink by blink, letter by letter, he dictated a memoir, which became an international bestseller and the basis for artist and director\n Julian Schnabel\u2019s fiercely beautiful film. \n \u00a0Working with the brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski ( Lincoln ,\n Saving Private Ryan ), Schnabel immerses us in Bauby&#39;s interior world \u2014 his memories, reveries, fantasies, loves and lusts \u2014 transforming a story of physical entrapment and spiritual renewal into exhilarating images.\n  \n \u00a0 \n Join us before the film for a talk by Frank Guenther, a professor in the Departments of Speech, Language &amp; Hearing Sciences and Biomedical Engineering at Boston University,\n where he also is Associate Director for the Graduate Program in Neuroscience. \u00a0 Professor Guenther uses a combination of brain imaging and computational modeling to characterize the brain networks involved in speech, and develops brain-machine\n interfaces (BMIs) that can restore speech and other capabilities to patients with locked-in syndrome.\u00a0 BMIs have produced astonishing laboratory demonstrations of locked-in patients controlling computers, speech synthesizers, and robotic arms using only their\n thoughts. Clinical trials are ongoing for several BMIs, promising a much more normal life for those with locked-in syndrome as these devices become widely available.  \n \u00a0 \n Part of the Coolidge Corner Theatre\u2019s ongoing\n Science on Screen series.

His current research concentrates on how organisms gather and use information from their environment,\n through active sensing and sensory decision-making. For example, Prof. Ritt and his students are studying the ways in which mice explore environments using their whiskers, employing a combination of computational analysis of high-speed video, electrophysiological\n recordings, and neurocontrol methods implemented by a real-time feedback system built on a digital signal processing architecture.

One challenge is the decision which parameters of the function should be optimized versus kept constant during optimization. Another is the sampling of the psychometric function that influences the optimization and the goodness of fit (Wichmann &amp; Hill, Perception &amp; Psychophysics 63(8), 2001). Thus, it is advised in the experiment design to account for proper sampling and make fewer assumptions by keeping parameters variable during the optimization. \n\n\n\n I will present a maximum likelihood method (Treutwein &amp; Strasburger, Perception &amp; Psychophysics 61(1), 1999; Myung, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 47, 2003) estimating the parameters of psychometric functions given sampled data.

The very existence of\nthese regions--in more or less the same place in every normal\nsubject--raises a host of new questions that I will address here. Are\nspecialized regions found only for evolutionarily old functions? Are\nthey found only for perceptual and motor systems, or also for abstract\nhigher-level thought? Can we develop new methods that can discover such\nspecializations even for functions that we do not hypothesize in\nadvance? How do specialized regions arise in development? Why do some\nmental functions get their own private patch of real estate in the\nbrain and others (apparently) do not? In addition to highly specialized\nregions, does the brain also have general-purpose regions that are\nengaged across a wide range of tasks? We do not yet have answers to all\nof these questions, but tantalizing clues are turning up all the time.  As with all Neuphi events, everyone is welcome to attend. The format normally involves a one hour talk followed by one hour of discussion. The website is http://www.neuphi.com for this and other events.

Search speed often correlates with target-distractor discriminability; search is faster when the target and distractors look quite different. \u00a0\u00a0 However, there are notable exceptions. A given discriminability can yield efficient searches (where the target seems to \u201cpop-out\u201d) as well as inefficient ones (where additional distractors make search significantly slower and more difficult). \u00a0\u00a0 Search is often more difficult when finding the target requires distinguishing a particular configuration or conjunction of features. \u00a0\u00a0 Search asymmetries abound. \u00a0\u00a0 These puzzling results have fueled three decades of theoretical and experimental studies. \u00a0\u00a0 We argue that the key issue in search is not the would-be appearance of items in the fovea, but rather the appearance of image patches in the periphery, where appearance is characterized by summary statistics computed over a sizable pooling region. By quantifying these statistics, we predict a set of classical search results, as well as peripheral discriminability of crowded patches such as those found in search displays. \u00a0\u00a0 Additional modeling allows us to quantitatively predict mean number of fixations to find the target. \n  Thanks, Sam", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Sam Norman-Haignere <svnh@mit.edu>", "subject": "Cog Lunch at Noon"}, {"date": "2011-10-17T15:48:14.000Z", "bodyText": "Let me know - \n \n \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: leemavros@gmail.com [mailto:leemavros@gmail.com] On Behalf Of Lee Mavros \nSent: Monday, October 17, 2011 11:46 AM \nSubject: Adele Diamond \n \nDear all, \n \nAs you may know, Dr. Adele Diamond will be visiting us on Wednesday, October 19.

Vaina \n \nIf the number of parameters to estimate exceeds the number \nof measurements, an estimation problem is said to be ill-posed. \nDue to limited acquisition times, physics of the problems \nand complexity of the brain, the field of brain imaging \nneeds to address many ill-posed problems. Among such problems \nare: the localization in space and time of active brain regions \nwith MEG and EEG, the estimation of functional networks from fMRI \nresting state data and what was is commonly called &quot;decoding&quot;. \nDecoding consists in predicting from fMRI data a behavorial \nvariable or classifying brain states using supervised learning \nmethods like SVM. In this talk I will describe some recent \ncontributions to all three problems. The concepts shared \nby the different methods presented are: \nestimation and statistical learning in high dimension, \nconvex optimization, sparse and structured priors. \n \n \nShort bio \n--------- \n \nAlexandre Gramfort is currently a research fellow at the Martinos Center for \nBiomedical Imaging in Boston working with Matti Hamalainen. He was previously \npostdoctoral fellow in the INRIA Parietal Project Team in Paris, France. He \nobtained his PhD in 2009 from Telecom ParisTech under the supervision of \nMaureen Clerc and Olivier Faugeras. He did his PhD jointly at INRIA in Sophia \nAntipolis and the Computer Science Department at the Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure \nin Paris. He graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in 2006 after a double \nmasters degree at Telecom ParisTech and the Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Cachan \n(DEA MVA). His research interests are on brain functional imaging (MEG, EEG, \nfMRI) and in particular on problems involving signal and image processing, \nscientific computing, numerical methods, data mining and machine learning. \nAlexandre Gramfort received an award for his PhD work from the EADS foundation, \nand awards at the Biomag conference in 2010 and HBM conference in 2011 for his \nwork on the MEG inverse problem. \n \nSome references \n--------------- \n \nFunctional Brain Imaging with M/EEG Using Structured Sparsity in Time-Frequency Dictionaries \nhttp://www.springerlink.com/content/mp7701m142193w83/ \n \nBrain covariance selection: better individual functional connectivity models using population prior \nhttp://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips23/NIPS2010_1054.pdf \n \nMulti-subject Dictionary Learning to Segment an Atlas of Brain Spontaneous Activity \nhttp://www.springerlink.com/content/c60kgvj402738763/ \n \nTotal variation regularization for fMRI-based prediction of behavior. \nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317080?dopt=Abstract \n \nMulti-scale Mining of fMRI data with Hierarchical Structured Sparsity \nhttp://fr.arxiv.org/abs/1105.0363 \n \n \n______________________________ \nLucia M.

Vocal hyperfunction is a common cause of and accompaniment to \nvoice disorders characterized by excessive laryngeal and paralaryngeal \ntension. Vocal hyperfunction can respond to behavioral intervention, but \nsuccessful treatment is dependent upon proper assessment. Although vocal \nhyperfunction accounts for 10 - 40 % of cases referred to multidisciplinary \nvoice clinics, current assessment is hampered by the lack of objective \nmeasures for detecting its presence or severity. \u00a0Our recent findings \nindicate promise for the use of the non-invasive acoustic measure of \nrelative fundamental frequency (RFF) as such a measure. RFF is the \nnormalized fundamental frequency of vocal cycles immediately before and \nafter voiceless consonant production. We have shown RFF to (i) discriminate \nbetween individuals with and without voice disorders associated with vocal \nhyperfunction, (ii) normalize after successful voice therapy toward values \nseen in unimpaired speakers, and (iii) correlate with listener \nauditory-perception of vocal effort. Our findings support future large-scale \nclinical studies of this measure. \n \n \n***Seminars start at 10:30AM in Room 203 at 44 Cummington St. and end by \nnoon. \u00a0The event calendar of the HRC talks could be found at \nhttp://www.bu.edu/dbin/hrc/calendar/. \n \nCome early for coffee and donuts and stay for lunch** \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-- \n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; \nFrank Guenther \nProfessor,\u00a0Departments of Speech, Language, &amp; Hearing \n\u00a0\u00a0 Sciences\u00a0and Biomedical Engineering \nAssociate Director, Graduate Program for Neuroscience \nBoston University \n677 Beacon Street \nBoston, MA 02215 \nPhone: 617-353-5765\u00a0\u00a0 Fax: 617-353-7755 \nguenther@bu.edu \nhttp://www.cns.bu.edu/~guenther \n&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; \n\n \n-- \nTo post to this group, send email to speechlabbu@googlegroups.com \nTo unsubscribe, send email to speechlabbu-unsubscribe@googlegroups.com \nFor more options, visit http://groups.google.com/group/speechlabbu?hl=en", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Frank Guenther <fguenth@gmail.com>", "subject": "[speechlabbu] Fwd: FW: HRC seminar tomorrow: Cara Stepp"}, {"date": "2011-10-06T15:49:32.000Z", "bodyText": "Please join us at this talk in the Computation Group Lecture Series, Department of Architecture, MIT:\u00a0    \u201cIt&#39;s Not What You Think: An Evolutionary Theory of Spiritual Enlightenment\u201d    October 7, 2011 12:30 - 2:00pm Room 7-431(Long Lounge)\u00a0     Jeff Lieberman Artist and Scientist, Founder, Plebian Design  Abstract: Take a broad perspective: Evolutionary theory provides us with an unpredictably deep connection with the cosmos \u2014 a 13 billion year-old family tree. Your grandfather 300 million years ago was a lizard. How did it experience life? Imagine the conscious experience of a reptile. Elements like vision are similar, but higher functions are absent. Reptile consciousness is, in some way, a definitively &#39;smaller&#39; version of consciousness than what we have today. As evolution has changed the structure of organisms, so has it changed the subjective experience. Don&#39;t forget, before any life existed, you were once rocks, air, and water, with a dash of lightning. This particular pattern of molecules known as a &#39;human being&#39; has evolved an amazing depth of consciousness: an ability to internally model the reality beyond the senses, to imagine futures that have never happened, to use language, to use rationality to build and test theories about our universe, to become self-aware. We often assume, due to these extreme capabilities, that the average adult consciousness in 2011 is the apex of the evolution of consciousness, and that it is now up to technology to propel us forward. So we work on changing the outside world to suit our needs, instead of changing ourselves and the way our minds function. As consciousness evolves, we gain wider and deeper understandings of the universe and of ourselves. Where might it be headed next and what insights might we find? I believe that we have specific pointers in front of us about the next qualitative stages in our evolution, and where this has led has been surprising. As our evolutionary shifts in consciousness define how we see the world in which we live, there may be nothing more important.

I will present some of our recent work on three \nrecursive neural network architectures that learn meaning \nrepresentations for such hierarchical structure. These models \nobtain state-of-the-art performance on several language and \nvision tasks. \n \nThe meaning of phrases and sentences is determined by the \nmeanings of its words and the rules of compositionality. We \nintroduce a recursive neural network (RNN) for syntactic parsing \nwhich can learn vector representations that capture both \nsyntactic and semantic information of phrases and sentences. For \ninstance, the phrases &quot;declined to comment&quot; and &quot;would not \ndisclose&quot; have similar representations. Since our RNN does not \ndepend on specific assumptions for language, it can also be used \nto find hierarchical structure in complex scene images.

This is in part because the symmetries of the nervous system are somewhat subtle, with classical group structures appearing less prevalently than a collection of local, groupoid symmetries. The recent dynamical systems literature has offered a compelling and intuitive case relating such structural symmetries to synchrony and phase-locking in networks of coupled dynamical systems. Such an approach is immediately relevant to network modelers who take a deterministic perspective, but related methods have been applied to stochastic systems as well.\u00a0 \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0The detection of symmetries and inference of their dynamical consequences establishes a rough outline of the relationship between a structure and its function. This is a major goal in the biological sciences in general, and to this end, I will present a &quot;physicist&#39;s proof&quot; of a theorem relating the left eigenvectors of a network&#39;s adjacency matrix to allowed synchronies and phase relationships. \u00a0As a corollary, we will find that the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of this matrix directly indicates a network&#39;s &quot;most synchronous&quot; possible state.\u00a0\u00a0We apply this method to reproduce a number of previous computational results and to discover unknown symmetries in some arbitrary networks. Regarding the proof as informal, though, properly formalizing the\u00a0statement remains a priority. The remainder of the talk will focus on some approaches taken toward this goal, extensions to the method, and speculation on the roles of synchrony and phase in the nervous system.", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Nan Jia <pacificmyth@gmail.com>", "subject": "[CNSO] Student Seminar: Rob Law, Thursday 4-5 pm + Refreshments"}, {"date": "2011-10-04T15:48:10.000Z", "bodyText": "Brains and Machines Seminar Series 2011/2012 \nGeometry/topology and statistical inference \nSpeaker: Sayan Mukherjee \nSpeaker Affiliation: Duke University \nHost: Lorenzo Rosasco \nHost Affiliation: Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT); CBCL, MIT \n \nDate: 10-4-2011 \nTime: 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM \nLocation: Sem Rm G449 (Patil/ Kiva) \n \nIn this talk I will illustrate two examples where geometric/topological ideas \nand statistical inference complement each other. In the first example, \ncomputational geometry is a central tool used to address a classic problem in \nstatistics, inference of conditional dependence. In the second example, a \nclassic object in topology and geometry, a Whitney stratified space, is stated \nas a mixture model and an algorithm for inference of mixture elements is \nprovided as well as finite sample bounds for the algorithm. \n \nThe first part of the talk develops a parameterization of hyper-graphs based \non the geometry of points in d-dimensions, the geometric tool here is the \nabstract simplicial complex. Informative prior distributions on hyper-graphs \nare induced through this parameterization by priors on point configurations \nvia spatial processes. The approach combines tools from computational geometry \nand topology with spatial processes and offers greater control on the \ndistribution of graph features than Erdos-Renyi random graphs. \n \nIn the second part of the talk, I describe the problem of stratification \nlearning. Strata correspond to unions and intersections of arbitrary manifolds \nof possibly different dimension. We consider a mixture distribution on the \nstrata and formulate the following learning problem: given n points sampled \niid from the mixture model which points belong to the same strata. I will \nstate a bound on the minimum number of sample points required to infer with \nhigh probability which points belong to the same strata.

Vocal hyperfunction can respond to behavioral\nintervention, but successful treatment is dependent upon proper assessment.\nAlthough vocal hyperfunction accounts for 10 \u2013 40 % of cases referred to\nmultidisciplinary voice clinics, current assessment is hampered by the lack of\nobjective measures for detecting its presence or severity.\u00a0 Our recent\nfindings indicate promise for the use of the non-invasive acoustic measure of\nrelative fundamental frequency (RFF) as such a measure. RFF is the normalized\nfundamental frequency of vocal cycles immediately before and after voiceless\nconsonant production. We have shown RFF to (i) discriminate between individuals\nwith and without voice disorders associated with vocal hyperfunction, (ii)\nnormalize after successful voice therapy toward values seen in unimpaired\nspeakers, and (iii) correlate with listener auditory-perception of vocal\neffort. Our findings support future large-scale clinical studies of this\nmeasure. \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nNicole Magni \nCenter Administrator \n Hearing  Research  Center  \n 44 Cummington Street ,\nRoom 412 \n Boston , MA \n 02215  \n \u00a0 \n office: 617-353-4358 \nfax: 617-353-6766 \n email: nshutt@bu.edu", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Cynthia Bradford <cindy@bu.edu>", "subject": "FW: October 7 - HRC Seminar"}, {"date": "2011-09-20T13:22:53.000Z", "bodyText": "From:  \n owner-cmbseminar-list@bu.edu [mailto: owner-cmbseminar-list@ bu.edu ] On Behalf Of Denise Parisi \n Sent: Tuesday, September 20, 2011\n8:54 AM \n To: Denise Parisi \n Subject: Matthew Shapiro talk\ntoday, 10AM  \n\n \n\n  \u00a0  \n\n \n\n  Boston   University     \n\n Center for Memory and Brain    \n\n Seminar Series    \n\n Welcomes    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n Professor Matthew Shapiro    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n  Mount   SinaiSchool   of Medicine    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n \u201cGoal directed learning and memory coding by the hippocampus\nand prefrontal cortex.\u201d    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n September 20, 2011    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n ***Seminar 10:00 \u2013 11:00***    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n 2 CummingtonStreet Room 109    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n All Welcome    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n  \u00a0    \n\n ***NOTE TIME/DAY CHANGE***", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Cynthia Bradford <cindy@bu.edu>", "subject": "FW: Matthew Shapiro talk today, 10AM"}, {"date": "2011-08-02T13:31:11.000Z", "bodyText": "---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Polley, Daniel &lt; Daniel_Polley@meei.harvard. edu &gt; \nDate: Fri, Jul 29, 2011 at 5:08 PM Subject: Cheung seminar 8/5 at 1 PM in the 4th floor conference room To: EPL-People &lt; EPL-People@meei.harvard.edu &gt; \n\n\n\n\n \n Please mark your calendar for the following talk on Friday, August 5th in the 4th floor conference room at 1 PM. \u00a0Let me know if you would like to meet with Steve individually. \n\n \n  &#39;Tinnitus Modulation by Electrical Stimulation of the Caudate Nucleus&#39; \n \nSteven W.

To better understand these processes, our laboratory has designed, experimentally tested, and iteratively refined a neural network model whose components correspond to the brain regions involved in speech. Babbling and imitation phases are used to train neural mappings between phonological, articulatory, auditory, and somatosensory representations. After learning, the model can produce syllables and words it has learned by generating movements of an articulatory synthesizer. Because the model&#39;s components correspond to neural populations and are given precise anatomical locations, activity in the model&#39;s cells can be compared directly to neuroimaging data. Computer simulations of the model account for a wide range of experimental findings, including data on acquisition of speaking skills, articulatory ! \n kinematics, and brain activity during speech. Furthermore, &quot;damaged&quot; versions of the model are being used to investigate several communication disorders, including stuttering, apraxia of speech, and spasmodic dysphonia. Finally, the model was used to guide development of a neural prosthesis aimed at restoring speech output to a profoundly paralyzed individual with an electrode permanently implanted in his speech motor cortex. The volunteer maintained a 70% hit rate after 5-10 practice attempts of each vowel in a vowel production task, supporting the feasibility of brain-machine interfaces with the potential to restore conversational speech abilities to the profoundly paralyzed. \n \n \nFUTURE SEMINARS: \n \n================================================= \nFriday, May 6 - NO SEMINAR - ENG SENIOR PROJECTS! \n================================================= \nFriday, May 13 \n10:30AM-noon \nRm 203, 44 Cummington St. \n \nProfessor Doug Oliver \nUniversity of Connecticut Health Center \n \nTitle: TBA \n \n================================================= \n \nFriday, June 17, 2011 \n10:30AM-noon \nRm 203, 44 Cummington St. \n \nDr. Matt Goupell \nBinaural Hearing and Speech Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison \n \nTitle: TBA", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Neuroscience, Graduate Program For\" <neurosci@bu.edu>", "subject": "FW: HRC Seminar TOMORROW - DR.

In essence, these constructs can decode and use the \nelectrophysiological signals representing cognitive intent. With the \nparallel evolution of neuroscience, engineering, and rapid computing, \nthe era of clinical neuroprosthetics is approaching as a practical \nreality for people with severe motor impairment. Patients with such \ndiseases as spinal cord injury, stroke, limb loss, and neuromuscular \ndisorders, may benefit through the utilization of these BCIs that \nserve to augment their ability to communicate and interact with their \nenvironment. This talk will focus on the emerging use of \nelectrocorticography (ECoG), local field potentials taken from the \nsurface of the brain, as a robust signal platform for neuroprosthetic \napplication. Emerging insights from this signal modality reveal that \nsubstantial motor and speech information can be derived from local \nfield potentials by looking at the higher frequency oscillations, \nknown as gamma rhythms. The combination of high information content, \nminimal level of invasiveness, and strong signal durability, make \nECoG-BCIs a likely candidate for real world neuroprosthetics in the \nfuture. \n \nHost: Contact Ed Boyden at esb@media.mit.edu to schedule appointments. \n \nBest, \nEd \n \n \n \n \n-- \nEd Boyden, Ph.

However, the principles governing how the auditory system -particularly at the level of auditory cortex- maps useful information from the environment into stable perceptual experiences remain unclear. A general proposal is that the system is constrained by ecological priors to shape the structure of neural computation. In this talk, I will discuss how neural responses over time can capture the statistics of speech sounds and how they influence the characteristics of a computational model of auditory cortical spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs). By constraining the ensemble output to be coherent in time, the resulting model receptive fields shed light on connections between the seemingly contradictory principles of sustained firing and sparseness in auditory sensory representations. Moreover, these findings suggest coding strategies that could mediate robust neural representations of speech signals in presence of unknown distortions by capturing the most informative statistics of speech. This framework puts constraints on the mapping from sound to internal representation along spectral and temporal modulation features with most important phonological information. \n \nInspired by these results, I will further discuss the relevance of such spectro-temporal modulation constraints in the recognition of speech sounds by both humans and machines. This analysis contrasts the predictability of speech recognition by human listeners based on overlap between speech modulation profiles and noise. It also provides a natural scheme to impart cortical principles into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. I will discuss a simple analysis based on modulation constraints for automatic phoneme recognition that outperforms several state-of-the-art ASR systems in non-stationary noise backgrounds.", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "H Steven Colburn <colburn@bu.edu>", "subject": "Title and Abstract for Mounya Elhilali's seminar Friday morning"}, {"date": "2011-04-19T22:01:02.000Z", "bodyText": "Boston \n University   \nClinical and Translational Science Institute  \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 Second Annual Translational Research Symposium\n  \n  \u00a0  \n Thursday, May 26, 2011, 8:00 AM-2:00 PM  \n  \u00a0  \n Boston University School of Management, 595 Commonwealth Avenue, 4th Floor  \n Boston, MA 02115  \n  \u00a0  \n Sponsored By:  \n The Boston University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI)  \n  http://ctsi.bu.edu/    \n David Center, MD, Institute Director and Associate Provost for Translational Research\n  \n  \u00a0  \n Activities will include  \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  \u00a0Poster session, with prizes  \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  Short talks: translational research challenges and successes at Boston University  \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  \u00a0Cross-campus networking\n  \n \n \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n  \u00a0Information on translational research resources at Boston University  \n  \u00a0  \n Keynote Speaker  \n  \u00a0  \n \n Robert S.

The spiking state is thought to be maintained by a positive feedback loop between a nonspecific calcium-sensitive cationic current (ICAN) carried by TRPC membrane channels and heightened intracellular calcium levels sustained during sufficiently fast spiking. Persistent spiking neurons in layer V of mEC are capable of sustaining a continuous range of stable spiking frequencies and can be switched to higher or lower frequencies by additional strong depolarizing or hyperpolarizing pulses, respectively. \u00a0This ability to generate graded persistent spiking has been hypothesized to underlie aspects of working memory, but it remains unclear if and to what extent persistent spiking is robust to the considerable fluctuating synaptic conductance that would be expected in vivo. \u00a0Furthermore, the contribution of ICAN to the input-output processing of these neurons has not been evaluated. In this study we use a multi\u2011compartmental GENESIS model of a layer V mEC neuron to investigate how ICAN might contribute to rate, spike time, and theta phase coding in these neurons. \u00a0In the absence of synaptic inputs, we vary either an applied holding current or the magnitude of a 1 second current pulse delivered to the base model or to a version of the model from which ICAN has been removed. \u00a0We then evaluate the spike frequency to applied current relationship at different time-points over the next 10 seconds. To explore the potential role of ICAN in spike time coding we deliver a 500 pA, 1 second current pulse during ongoing stochastic backgrounds composed of 1 nS AMPA and GABA synaptic events delivered to the soma. These backgrounds are intended to represent the in vivo high-conductance state. We then evaluate the spike-triggered average (STA) of the CAN current before and after the pulse. We also derive the STAs of voltage (mean spike shape) and AMPA and GABA input conductances to evaluate how activation of ICAN might affect spike threshold and sensitivity to synaptic input fluctuations. Lastly, we delivered theta modulated synaptic input to the model and evaluate the preferred firing phase of the model for different levels of ICAN activation. We find that: 1) ICAN shapes the spike frequency to current relationship in a time-dependent manner; 2) The CAN current can support long-lasting elevated firing rates following strong excitation amidst ongoing stochastic synaptic activity; 3) Activation of the CAN current with a current pulse increases sensitivity to future synaptic input fluctuations; 4) Increased sensitivity is long-lasting and is greater for stronger pulses, allowing the CAN current to act as an intrinsic gain control mechanism.\n \n\n\n\n \n -- Nan Jia Cognitive and Neural Systems Boston University", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Nan Jia <pacificmyth@gmail.com>", "subject": "[TALKS] Fwd: NaK meets this Wed, Mar 30, at 4:00 PM"}, {"date": "2011-03-24T14:06:08.000Z", "bodyText": "Boston University Graduate Program for Neuroscience \n \n2011 Distinguished Lecture Series \n \nElly Nedivi, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, \nPicower Institute, MIT \n \n&quot;The Role of Activity-Regulated Genes in Cortical Circuit Plasticity&quot; \nFriday, 25th March 2011 \nPhotonics, Room 206 \nLecture 12:00 p.m. \nPlease join us for lunch following the talk. \n \nNedivi seminar location is at CRC, Photonics Center- 8 St. Mary&#39;s \nStreet-room 206.

MEG is a safe and noninvasive technique for measuring neuronal activity in the human brain. Using magnetic sensors surrounding the head, MEG records the weak magnetic fields generated by active neurons. The new MEG scanner, an Electa Triux with 306 channels plus 128 channels for EEG, is housed at the Martinos Imaging Center at MIT, within a 3-layer shielded room with active compensation coils to reduce magnetic background noise. The imaging facility is available to the entire MIT community and to their external collaborators.\n\n The following two-part lecture will introduce the new imaging technology.\n\n Title: \tMagnetoencephalography Imaging Technology\n Part 1: Introduction to MEG Imaging\n Part 2: MEG Operational Procedures\n Speaker: Ronald S. Gordon, Ph.D., Elekta Neuromag, Canada\n Time: 10am-12pm\n Date: Monday, 21 March 2011\n Location: PILM Seminar Room, MIT 46-3310\n\n Abstract: This 2-part lecture will introduce MEG imaging to the MIT community. The first hour will provide an overview of MEG, including: historical development, basic MEG physics, noise cancellation, basic source modeling, and experimental and clinical applications. After a break, the second hour will concentrate on operational details of the Elekta Triux MEG System and is targeted to individuals who may be interested in using the imaging facility.\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n Contact: Dimitrios Pantazis \n email: pantazis@MIT.EDU | tel: 617.715.4330 \n \n\n\n  \n\n\n \nTo unsubscribe from our Institute News mailing list, please reply to this message with the text UNSUBSCRIBE in the body of the email.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n ______________________________ _________________ \nBcs-talks mailing list \n Bcs-talks@mit.edu \n http://mailman.mit.edu/ mailman/listinfo/bcs-talks", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Yoojin Chung <yoojin.chung@gmail.com>", "subject": "Fwd: Lecture: Magnetoencephalography Imaging Technology"}, {"date": "2011-03-14T19:28:43.000Z", "bodyText": "---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Kathleen Veronica Dickey &lt; kvdickey@mit.edu &gt; \nDate: Mon, Mar 14, 2011 at 10:38 AM Subject: RE: BCS Special Seminar: Faculty Candidate: tomorrow, Tuesday 3.15.111 at 10am; Josh H.

In doing so we solve a number of difficult and intriguing computational problems. We recognize sound sources despite large variability in the waveforms they produce, extract behaviorally relevant attributes that are not explicit in the input to the ear, and do so even when sound sources are embedded in dense mixtures with other sounds. This talk will describe my recent work investigating how we accomplish these feats. The work stems from two premises: first, that understanding perception requires understanding real-world sensory stimuli and their representation in the brain, and second, that a theory of the perception of some property should enable the synthesis of signals that appear to have that property. Sound synthesis can thus be used to probe phenomena inaccessible to conventional experimental methods. I will discuss three related strands of research along these lines. The first strand uses sound textures (as produced by rain, swarms of insects, or galloping horses) as a window into the auditory system, synthesizing textures from statistics of biological sound representations as tests of the perceptual relevance of different acoustic measurements. The second strand uses naturalistic synthetic sounds to reveal new aspects of sound segregation. The third strand, currently in progress, capitalizes on the ease with which real-world sound sources and their mixtures can be obtained, using large-scale statistical analysis of sounds to empirically study the sound properties that serve as grouping cues. Collectively they indicate that simple statistical properties of auditory representations capture a surprising number of important perceptual phenomena. \n \u00a0 \u00a0  \n  \n \u00a0 \n Kathleen V.

Naming deficits are the most persistent language deficits observed in patients with aphasia. Currently, clinicians proceed from simple items to complex items during therapy of naming deficits. Our previous work, however, has demonstrated that training the more complex atypical examples (e.g., garlic ) of a category (e.g., vegetable) results in generalization to the less complex typical examples (e.g., carrots ) in aphasic patients with naming deficits (Kiran, 2007). An important unresolved question is whether behavioral improvements following the treatments described above are due to some long lasting neural reorganization of restored function or due to the development of alternative behavioral strategies (Ramage, Kiran &amp; Robin, 2007). Therefore, a natural progression of my research program now involves the implementation of advanced imaging technology to carefully examine the basis of language recovery subsequent to behavioral treatment in individuals with aphasia. In this talk, I will present data from our rehabilitation studies that provide the basis for assuming systematic and effective recovery of language skills in monolingual and bilingual aphasia. I will also present data from neuroimaging studies that examine the neural basis of language recovery and language rehabilitation in aphasia. Our recent evidence indicates that perilesional and undamaged regions in the lesioned hemisphere are engaged in language recovery subsequent to rehabilitation. \n \u00a0 Full seminar schedule: http://www.masseyeandear.org/ research/ent/eaton-peabody/ epl-seminar-schedules/ \nDirections: http://www.masseyeandear.org/ about-us/maps-directions/main- campus/", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Yoojin Chung <yoojin.chung@gmail.com>", "subject": "Fwd: Talk at MEEI on Friday March 11: Kiran on aphasia"}, {"date": "2011-03-07T02:41:31.000Z", "bodyText": "Dear CRCers, \n \nVarious groups at Boston University are sponsoring a Mini-Symposium on \nBrain Rhythms and Audition.

One of the most well-studied of these processes is spatial attention, which affects both perception and the gains of visual neurons. We also found evidence that changes in spatial attention are associated with changes in the extent to which trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses is shared across a population. \u00a0We tested the hypothesis that a common mechanism mediates all processes that change gains by training rhesus monkeys to perform a task in which we could simultaneously manipulate spatial attention and a form of feature or task attention. We compared the effects of feature and spatial attention on local and spatially separated populations by recording simultaneously from dozens of neurons in both hemispheres of V4. Feature and spatial attention affect the activity of local populations similarly, modulating both firing rates and correlations between pairs of nearby neurons. However, while spatial attention appears to act on local populations, feature attention is coordinated across hemispheres. Our results are consistent with a unified attentional mechanism that can modulate the responses of arbitrary subgroups of neurons.\n \n\n\n \n\n \n -- Nan Jia Cognitive and Neural Systems Boston University", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Nan Jia <pacificmyth@gmail.com>", "subject": "[CNSO]Fwd: NaK meets this **THU**, 3/3, at 4:00"}, {"date": "2011-02-28T15:48:21.000Z", "bodyText": "Talk with lunch 12:00-1:00pm, Memory Dessert to follow. 2 Cummington Street , Room 109B   \u00a0  Talk title:\u00a0   &quot;Neural signal integration in dendrites and axons in the hippocampus&quot;    \u00a0  \u00a0  Please join us for Dr. Spruston&#39;s presentation and lunch.

Classically, the analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has focused either on the creation of static maps localizing the metabolic fingerprints of neural processes or on studying their temporal evolution in a few pre-selected regions in the human brain. However, cognition recruits the entire brain and the underlying mental processes are fundamentally spatio-temporal in nature. By neglecting either the temporal dimension or the spatial entirety of brain function, such methods must necessarily compromise on extracting and representing all the information contained in the data. In this work, I present a new paradigm to facilitate a multivariate spatio-temporal model that allows a time-resolved exploration of mental processes as captured by fMRI. Using a state-space formalism that models the brain transitioning through a sequence of cognitive states as it solves a mental task, we are able to study the spatial distribution of activity along with its temporal structure. In addition to revealing the mental patterns of an individual subject, such a generative model enables group-level inferences in terms of information-theoretic properties such as complexity and mutual information. Efficient algorithms for estimating the parameters, state-sequence and the hemodynamic behavior of the brain have been developed. This method was applied to a multi-subject fMRI study for developmental disorders such as dyslexia and dyscalculia (i.e. math learning disability). I shall show the kind of inferences possible with this method in analyzing and differentiating the groups and the neuro-scientific conclusions that it provides. ______________________________ _________________ Brainmap website http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard. edu/martinos/training/ brainMap_2010-2011.php [ www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ] Brainmap subscription https://mail.nmr.mgh.harvard. edu/mailman/listinfo/brainmap [ mail.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ] ------------------------------ ------------------------------ ---------- \n \nThe information in this e-mail is intended only for the person to whom it is \naddressed.

Because the cortex and the surrounding anatomy have irregular geometries as well as inhomogeneous and anisotropic electrical properties, the mechanisms by which CES has therapeutic effects is poorly understood. Therapeutic effects of CES can be improved by optimizing the stimulation parameters based on the effects of various stimulation parameters on target brain regions. \n\n \nIn this study the effects of CES pulse polarity, frequency, and amplitude were investigated on unit activity (spikes), local field potentials (LFP), and electrocorticograms (ECoG) recorded from rat primary motor cortex. The results showed that units located in lower cortical layers are preferentially excited by anodic stimulation, while cathodic stimulation excites those located in upper cortical layers. These opposing effects were also frequency- and amplitude-dependent. Time-frequency analysis of LFPs showed high correlation of gamma frequencies with unit activity in corresponding layers. On the other hand, high gamma power of ECoG signals only showed high correlation with the unit activity in lower layers. Time-frequency correlations, which were found between LFPs, ECoGs and unit activity were also frequency- and amplitude- dependent. The data demonstrates that the poststimulus effects in neural activity after manipulation of CES parameters changes according to the location (depth) of the recorded neural activity in motor cortex. The signature of the neural activity observed in LFP and ECoG signals provides a better understanding of the effects of stimulation on the affected network and has a promising potential to be used in closed-loop control stimulation systems. These results demonstrate that the neurorehabilitation and neuroprosthetic applications of CES can be further improved by optimizing CES parameters. \n\n \n \n \n -- &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Frank Guenther \nProfessor,\u00a0Departments of Speech, Language, &amp; Hearing\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sciences\u00a0and Cognitive &amp; Neural Systems Associate Director, Graduate Program for Neuroscience Boston University 677 Beacon Street Boston, MA 02215 \nPhone: 617-353-5765\u00a0\u00a0 Fax: 617-353-7755 guenther@bu.edu http://www.cns.bu.edu/~ guenther &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; \n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n-- \nTo post to this group, send email to speechlabbu@googlegroups.com \nTo unsubscribe, send email to speechlabbu-unsubscribe@ googlegroups.com \nFor more options, visit http://groups.google.com/ group/speechlabbu?hl=en", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "Frank Guenther <fguenth@gmail.com>", "subject": "[speechlabbu] Fwd: Wed 2/16, 2pm, Azadeh Yazdan-Shahmorad talk"}, {"date": "2011-02-04T00:11:02.000Z", "bodyText": "Boston \n       University   \n     Clinical and Translational Science Institute  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n     \n     \u00a0  \n     \n     \n     \u00a0  \n     \n     \n     \u00a0 SAVE THE DATE  \n      \u00a0  \n      Second\n      Annual\n        \n      Translational\n      Research Symposium   \n      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n        \n      Thursday,\n      May 26, 2011  \n      \u00a0  \n      8:00 AM\n      \u2013 3:00 PM  \n      \u00a0  \n      Boston\n      University School of Management\n        \n      595\n      Commonwealth Avenue, 4th Floor   \n      Boston,\n      MA 02115  \n      \u00a0  \n      Sponsored\n      By:  \n      The\n      Boston University Clinical and Translational\n      Science Institute (CTSI)  \n      http://ctsi.bu.edu/  \n      David\n      Center, MD, Institute Director and Associate\n      Provost for Translational Research\n         \n      \u00a0  \n      Activities\n       will include  \n     \n      \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\n       \u00a0Poster\n      session, with prizes  \n     \n      \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\n       \u00a0Short\n      talks: translational research challenges and\n      successes at Boston University  \n     \n      \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\n       \u00a0Cross-campus\n      networking and small group discussions  \n     \n      \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\n       \u00a0Information\n      on translational research resources at Boston\n      University  \n      \u00a0  \n      Keynote Speaker  \n      Robert S.

Although the auditory cortex has been \nshown to play important roles in sound localization, how cortical \nneurons process mixed spatial and spectral information of multiple \nsounds is not entirely clear. In this talk, I will discuss results on \nspatial and frequency selectivity of individual neurons in the primary \nauditory cortex (A1) of awake marmoset monkeys. I will show that the \nspatial receptive fields (SRFs) of A1 neurons measured in the awake \ncondition typically contained a restricted excitatory region that was \nsurrounded by inhibition. Interestingly, the frequency selectivity of \nA1 neurons was found to be largely location-invariant. These findings \nindicate that A1 neurons receive widespread spatial inputs that are \ncomposed of both excitation and inhibition and that the balance \nbetween excitatory and inhibitory inputs results in spatial \nselectivity of A1 neurons without altering their frequency \nselectivity. This joint spatial and spectral processing scheme may \nunderlie A1 neurons\u2019 ability to encode spatial-spectral-temporal \nrelationships of multiple sounds.", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "H Steven Colburn <colburn@bu.edu>", "subject": "Yi Zhou seminar Friday - reminder"}, {"date": "2011-01-05T18:49:57.000Z", "bodyText": "Rich Stern from Carnegie Mellon U. will be here all day next Tuesday.\u00a0 \nHe is giving a talk from 2 to 3 pm on a topic of great interest to me\nand to many people these days. \n(The talk will be in Room 203 of 44 Cummington Street.) \n \nTITLE:\u00a0\u00a0\n &quot;The impact of the\ndistribution of internal delays in binaural models on predictions for\npsychoacoustical data&quot;\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 OR\u00a0  &quot;Revisionist theories in\nbinaural hearing \u2026. does the distribution of delays really matter?&quot; \n \nABSTRACT: \n J effress&#39;s theory of\nbinaural interaction has played a dominant role in the modeling of\nbinaural phenomena since its introduction more than 60 years ago.\nCentral to these models is a network of binaural coincidence-counting\nunits that respond to simultaneous excitation from each of the two\nears after a fixed internal delay. The predictions of these models\nfor a broad range of binaural phenomena, including subjective lateral\nposition, interaural discrimination, binaural detection, and dichotic\npitch, are critically dependent on the shape of the function that\ndescribes the distribution of the binaural units with respect to\ntheir internal delays and best frequencies. In recent years new\ntheories have challenged the traditional notion that the distribution\nfunction that best describes the widest variety of perceptual data is\na broadly tapered function that decreases monotonically with\nincreasing internal delay. Most arguments in support of the new\ntheories have been based on physiological evidence or on the results\nof a limited set of psychoacoustical experiments. In this talk we\nwill review the considerations that have motivated the traditional\nassumptions about the distributions of the internal delays, and we\nwill critically evaluate the extent to which the new theories as\nwell as the traditional binaural models are able to describe and\npredict experimental results for the broadest set of binaural\nperceptual phenomena, independently of physiological considerations. \n \nABOUT RICH STERN: \n Richard\nM. Stern received the S.B. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology in 1970, the M.S. from the University of California,\nBerkeley, in 1972, and the Ph.D. from MIT in 1977, all in electrical\nengineering. He has been on the faculty of Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity since 1977, where he is currently a Professor in the\nElectrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Biomedical\nEngineering Departments, the Language Technologies Institute, and a\nLecturer in the School of Music. Dr. Stern\u2019s initial research had\nbeen in the area of \n\n\n\n auditory\nperception, where he is best known for theoretical work in binaural\nperception. Much of Dr. Stern&#39;s current research is in spoken\nlanguage systems, where he is particularly concerned with the\ndevelopment of both physiologically-motivated and statistically-based\ntechniques with which automatic speech recognition can be made more\nrobust with respect to changes in environment and acoustical\nambience. Dr. Stern is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of\nAmerica, the 2008-2009 Distinguished Lecturer of the International\nSpeech Communication Association, a recipient of the Allen Newell\nAward for Research Excellence in 1992, and he served as General Chair\nof Interspeech 2006. He is also a member of the IEEE and the Audio\nEngineering Society.", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "H Steven Colburn <colburn@bu.edu>", "subject": "\"BINAURAL TALK\" NEXT TUESDAY  AT 2 PM- Richard Stern"}, {"date": "2010-12-15T16:57:14.000Z", "bodyText": "From:  Eatock, Ruth\nAnne \n Sent: Wednesday, December 15, 2010\n8:01 AM \n To: SAP-Talks \n Subject: SAP Talks: Michael Slama\non Dec 17 on reverberation and amplitude envelope coding   \n\n \n\n  \u00a0  \n\n  \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n   Friday\nDecember 17 2010 , 2 pm  \n\n 3rd\nFloor:\u00a0 Sloane Rm, MEEI,  243\n Charles Street  Boston  02114    \n\n Michael Slama, Speech &amp; Hearing HST program and EPL   \n\n Effect of reverberation on the coding of\namplitude envelope in the auditory midbrain  \n\n host:\n Bertrand_Delgutte@meei. harvard.edu   \n\n  \u00a0  \n\n Full\nseminar schedule: http://www.masseyeandear.org/ research/ent/eaton-peabody/ epl-seminar-schedules/ \n \nDirections: http://www.masseyeandear.org/ about-us/maps-directions/main- campus/", "bodyHtml": null, "from": "\"Chung, Yoojin\" <Yoojin_Chung@meei.harvard.edu>", "subject": "FW: SAP Talks: Michael Slama on Dec 17 on reverberation and amplitude envelope coding"}, {"date": "2010-12-15T02:37:42.000Z", "bodyText": "Hi All, I encourage you to attend these talks in general, and in particular the Jeff Markowitz talk on long-term stability in neural signals below.
